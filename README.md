<!--Introduction -->
Hello! I'm Kevin Hierro, a dedicated Agile Software Crafter at Lean Mind, based in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canarias, España. My journey in the tech world has always been driven by a strong desire to learn, overcome challenges, and help others along the way. I am particularly motivated to create software solutions that enable individuals to be less dependent on technology, advocating for more open, free, and quality software​​.

My expertise includes a wide range of agile methodologies such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD), Test Driven Development (TDD), and Extreme Programming (XP). I also have a solid foundation in different types of testing, clean code practices, and refactoring. My technical skills span across various technologies including Java, Kotlin, Python, C#, Docker, and TypeScript.

During my time at Lean Mind, I've explored various aspects of craftmanship, recognizing that it takes significantly more than two months for someone to grasp the many facets of this practices.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute or drop me a message to discuss anything tech-related. Let's collaborate and create amazing software solutions together!
