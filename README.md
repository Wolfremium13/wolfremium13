<!-- Greeting -->
# Hey there! I'm Wolfremium :wave::smiley:

<!--Introduction -->
Hello! I'm Kevin Hierro, a dedicated Agile Software Crafter at Lean Mind, based in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canarias, España. My journey in the tech world has always been driven by a strong desire to learn, overcome challenges, and help others along the way. I am particularly motivated to create software solutions that enable individuals to be less dependent on technology, advocating for more open, free, and quality software​​.

My expertise includes a wide range of agile methodologies such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD), Test Driven Development (TDD), and Extreme Programming (XP). I also have a solid foundation in different types of testing, clean code practices, and refactoring. My technical skills span across various technologies including Java, Kotlin, Python, C#, Docker, and TypeScript.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute or drop me a message to discuss anything tech-related. Let's collaborate and create amazing software solutions together!
